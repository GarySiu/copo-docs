#Coposition API docs
##[Now live on github pages](http://earlymarket.github.io/copo-docs/)
This is our personalised fork of [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate/).

* `git clone` it and `bundle install`
* To view it locally, use `middleman server`
* Livereload is included
* <strike>To compile it for use in the site, use `middleman build`</strike> At the moment we're deploying to github pages. Use `bash deploy.sh` to automatically build and push it up.
* The bulk of the docs are in /source/index.html.md
* If it gets too big, split it into seperate md files and put it in the includes folder
